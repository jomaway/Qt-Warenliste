A small example application in qt with a table widget

## Build and run this application

You can clone and open this project with qt creator. To do that do the following:

2. Select `New->Projekt importieren->Git clone`

The QFileDialog may open behind the mainWindow. This is some bug within QT which i not so important for us. 
So maybe you need to minimize the application to see the QFileDialog!
